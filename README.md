# Advent of Code #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dhedegaard/adventofcode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dhedegaard/adventofcode)

This is my repository for answers to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges during December '15.

If you want to run the examples locally, remember to `go get` the packages in
travis.yml, since I use various 3rd party libraries in some of the
implementations.
